# Timer and Planner

This browser application runs preset times using the Toggl API, allows user to create events using Google Calendar and add tasks to Notion database. 

## Motivation

My goal with this browser application was to have all my regularly used applications in one place and accessible instead of jumping tab to tab. 


## GUI
